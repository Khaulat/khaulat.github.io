-> ### Hi!ðŸ˜ƒ I'm Khaulat and I contribute to making the world a better place.

I learn, understand and teach reasoning and how information is processed to find solutions to some of the worlds' problems. 

Technically, I'm currently a machine learning researcher/developer currently working with brilliant folks at [For.ai](https://for.ai/)

In August, 2018, I founded an Artificial Intelligence community, AI Saturdays Abeokuta to help newbies and enthusiasts learn about AI and also provide a platform for practitioners in the field to network. It hasn't stopped growing ever since and has helped many transition into the field. 
I also organize/co-organize and speak at many other meetups around tech. Basically, I love building community!

Writing articles and recording videos mostly in form of tutorials or lessons around machine learning or general topics I am interested in, is also one thing I love doingðŸ¤©.

I am the best immaginary dancer the world has ever knownðŸ˜…. Hopefully I'll be real some day. Always looking forward to travelling and visiting interesting places across the globe. <-
